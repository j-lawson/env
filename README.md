# env
Linux environment files

This respository just contains a few files to set up a linux command line environment the way I like it. 

This includes:

* aliases
* generic scripts
* PATH variable setup


### Installing

Just clone the repo and add a line like this into your .bashrc:

```
source path/to/repo/bashsetup.sh
```
